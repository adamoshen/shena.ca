I am a PhD student studying data science at [Carleton University](https://carleton.ca/dsa/),
supervised by [Dr. Dave Campbell](https://people.math.carleton.ca/~davecampbell/Dave_Campbell.html).

My master's thesis,
[*Tales of a Coronavirus Pandemic: Topic Modelling with Short-Text Data*](https://doi.org/10.22215/etd/2021-14497),
explored graphical, quantitative, and statistical methods for analysing unstructured short-text data related to the
COVID-19 pandemic. I presented my findings at the Ninth Annual Canadian Statistics Students Conference and was
awarded 2nd Prize for the Graduate Oral Presentation Award (Master's).

I am also an [analyst at CRA](https://profils-profiles.science.gc.ca/en/profile/adam-shen).
