./themes/github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-modules/wowchemy/layouts/partials
	- Where all the html layout files live. Only modify the site_footer.html to designate yourself as a sponsor
	in order to customize the footer message.
	- The other files should be duplicated before modifying and placing in the ./layouts/partials/ folder for 
	override

./config.yaml
	- Controls some site settings. Enable highlight: codefences: true to get syntax highlighting.

./config/_default/
	- menus.yaml: controls the order appearance and order of menu navbar items. Link to sub-pages using `folder/`
	which references `./content/folder/`
	- params.yaml: site colour theme, fonts, contact info, menu controls, other site features

./content/authors/yourname(admin)/
	- _index.md: your personal information, role, affiliation, education, biographical information. Mostly supplies
	the info that goes in your "about" section

./content/home/
	- Markdown layout files for widgets. Toggle `active` to true or false to enable or disable certain widgets.
	Alternatively delete the file. Can be re-retrieved from the exampleSite in the themes/ folder

./content/post/
	- Where your blog posts live

./layouts/partials/
	- Where you store your custom html override files

./public/
	- Contains the files used to build your website, and the materials you typically upload to the host.

./static/media/
	- Where you can place additional resources such as images or files. I think only non-blog content can access
	these files using ./static/media/file. Blog posts are knit in the current directory rather than the project
	directory.

Links
	Specify links as [linktext](/folder/file) for absolute paths
	Specify links as [linktext](folder/file) for relative paths
	Don't need quotes, don't need to bother with shortcodes

./themes/github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-modules/wowchemy/data/themes
	- Where the default themes are stored
	- #4caf50 is the accent colour for the forest theme

Copy and paste files from
./themes/github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-modules/wowchemy/layouts/partials/widgets
to
./layouts/partials/widgets
for safe override
	- about.html: Changed the graduate cap colour to match accent colour. Remember to use color and not colour.
		- Added markdownify in the source HTML to add institution links
	- contact.html: Changed the envelope icon colour to match accent colour since this is probably the only
	form of contact that will be displayed. Remember to use color and not colour

./themes/github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-modules/wowchemy/archetypes
	- Shows all possible YAML header fields for different file types
