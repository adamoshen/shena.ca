This folder contains copies of all modified vendored files (just in case). Adding partials to this
directory actually does nothing. The ones that have an effect are the ones located in:

`themes/github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes/modules/wowchemy/v5/layouts/...`

And yes, I'm aware that you're not supposed to directly modify the vendored files but it's the
simplest solution
